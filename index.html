		<p>Simple Hex is a two-player connection game. The rules are simple, this game can be learned quickly.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Each player chooses a colour, red or blue. Players take turns colouring a single empty cell within the overall playing board. The goal for each player is to form a connected path of those cells linking opposite sides of the board marked by their colours. The first player to complete the connection wins the game.
			<br/>
			<br/>
The game by default supports AI (player name: "ai") and pass & play modes. In AI, It allows three levels of AI difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and AI can play either as first player or second player. Alternately, user can choose to enable multi player local play by choosing the pass & play mode.
			<br/>
			<br/>
The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. If you do not like your last move(s), you can use the undo button. This option is not available in the AI version yet
			<br/>
			<br/>
Steal Move: Since in Hex the first player has a distinct advantage, the second player has an option to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move. Thus the first player is forced to choose a first move that will not give a definite win. This option is not available in the AI version
			<br/>

Please share your feedback (available via Rules section), especially if you have find needed improvements. We introduced 3 board sizes 7X7, 9X9 and 11X11 so that users gradually mature to play longer versions of the game. Hence the name, Simple Hex.
